Software Engineer test for: https://launchcart.com/jobs/

Create a simple SaaS contact manager.

The platform must be able to register and login users.
Each member can add multiple contacts.
Each contact will have:

-   first name,
-   email,
-   phone.

All contacts data will be synced to https://www.klaviyo.com/ (You will need to register for a free account to get your API info).

-   Add a button in Laravel app that will track in Klavio that the button was clicked and the time it was clicked. This button with have no other purpose.
